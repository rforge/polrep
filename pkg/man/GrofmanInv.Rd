\title{Calculates the inverted Grofman index of proportionality}
\description{Calculates the inverted Grofman index of proportionality based on a population vector and a vector for the representatives}
\usage{GrofmanInv(Z,R)}
\arguments{
  \item{Z}{Population vector}
  \item{R}{Vector for the representatives}
}
\details{The order of the groups in he population vector and the vector for the representatives needs to be the same. If there are groups A, B, C in the population, both vectors need to cover their proportion in the same order.

The inverted Grofman index is 1 minus the sum the absolute differences between the proportion of the population and representatives in each group. A division by the effective number of groups is applied.
}
\value{A single score given the population and representatives}
