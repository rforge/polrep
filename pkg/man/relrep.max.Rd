\title{Calculates maximum R-score of any minority group}
\description{Calculates R-scores for each group, based on a population vector and a vector for the representatives. Reports the largest R-score for any individual group.}
\usage{relrep.max(Z,R)}
\arguments{
  \item{Z}{Population vector}
  \item{R}{Vector for the representatives}
}
\details{Relative representation scores (\code{\link{relrep}}) are calculated for each minority group. The majority group must be in first position of the vector.
