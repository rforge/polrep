\title{Calculates a modified Grofman index of proportionality}
\description{Calculates a modified Grofman index of proportionality based on a population vector and a vector for the representatives}
\usage{GrofmanMod(Z,R)}
\arguments{
  \item{Z}{Population vector}
  \item{R}{Vector for the representatives}
}
\details{The order of the groups in he population vector and the vector for the representatives needs to be the same. If there are groups A, B, C in the population, both vectors need to cover their proportion in the same order.

The modified Grofman index is the sum the absolute differences between the proportion of the population and representatives in each group. A division by the effective number of groups in the population is applied. To divide by the effective number of groups among the representatives, use \code{\link{Grofman}}.
}
\value{A single score given the population and representatives}
